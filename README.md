# Project_5_Desktop_database_app

This is the 5rd project in the Python Mega Course on Udemy. I made a desktop bookstore app with a simple database
It has minimal functions including: Add, delete, update, search, view all items. The frontend held me for longer than I expected.
I had to do a lot of reading to make the GUI least ugly. Geometry management is really a stressful and painful thing to do.
As for the backend, I learnt about database fundamentals in the last semester so writing queries wasn't a big problem.
Anyway, I got a lot of great experience while making this project. It's one of the most interesting project I've done so far
during 2021 Tet holiday. It's great not to see myself stuffed with foods, video games and Netflix movies!.
